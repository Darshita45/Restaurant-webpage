	<h2>About Restaurant Service</h2>
	<p>For a memorable meal the quality of the service is something that guests often remember as much as the food and drink served.</br>

That means that restaurant servers must show extensive knowledge of all types of cuisine and dishes, especially the ingredients and cooking style of the dishes on an a la carte menu. They will need to know and understand the methods of preparation and serving, along with the tools used.</br>

Regardless of whether it is a self-service cafeteria or a five star hotel restaurant good manners, a smart appearance, and impeccable personal hygiene are equally essential.</p>
